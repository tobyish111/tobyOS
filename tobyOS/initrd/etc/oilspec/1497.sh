# This is the bash-specific bug here:
# https://blogs.janestreet.com/when-bash-scripts-bite/
# See inherit_errexit below.
#
# I remember finding a script that relies on bash's bad behavior, so OSH copies
# it.  But you can opt in to better behavior.

set -o errexit
echo $(echo one; false; echo two)  # bash/ash keep going
echo parent status=$?
# dash and mksh: inner shell aborts, but outer one keeps going!
