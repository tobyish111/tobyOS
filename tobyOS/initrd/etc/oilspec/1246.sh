# Test with SIGURG because the default handler is SIG_IGN
#
# If we use SIGUSR1, I think the shell reverts to killing the process

# https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/signal.7.html

trap 'echo SIGURG' URG

kill -URG $$

# Hm trap doesn't happen here
{ echo begin child; sleep 0.1; echo end child; } &
kill -URG $!
wait
echo "wait status $?"

# In the CI, mksh sometimes gives:
#
# USR1
# begin child
# done
# 
# leaving off 'end child'.  This seems like a BUG to me?
