# bash and mksh agree, but this doesn't really make sense to me.
# In OSH, "$@" is the only real array, so that's why it behaves differently.



# TODO:
# - unquoted args of whitespace are not elided (when IFS = null)
# - empty quoted args are kept
#
# - $* $@ with empty IFS
# - $* $@ with custom IFS
#
# - no splitting when IFS is empty
# - word splitting removes leading and trailing whitespace

# TODO: test framework needs common setup

# Test IFS and $@ $* on all these
