# Chromium bring-up: hypothesis ledger

Every hypothesis tested, what killed or confirmed it, and the evidence. Kept so
nobody (including me) re-runs a disproven idea, and so a confirmed-looking story
has to show its receipts.

**Status key:** CONFIRMED (fixed, verified) · DISPROVEN (measured, dead) ·
REAL-BUT-NOT-THE-CAUSE (genuine defect, did not explain the symptom) · OPEN.

## Blocker B — "Corruption detected in shared-memory segment" ×3

| # | Hypothesis | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| B1 | Stale/zero pages when the shm cache grows | DISPROVEN | Populated newly-allocated pages on every mapping; corruption stayed at 3. |
| B2 | The page double-free was corrupting segments | DISPROVEN | Double-free fixed; corruption still 3. |
| B3 | **Inode NUMBERS are recycled, so the inode-keyed shm cache aliased unrelated regions** | **CONFIRMED** | `[ino]` trace: inode 9 allocated **6×** in one boot; `[shm]` showed six processes "attaching" to ino 9 at **four different sizes**. Keyed on (ino, incarnation) → corruption **3 → 0**, stable across every run since. |

Lesson: the `[shm]` trace saying "attached" *looked* like success but meant
*aliased*. Verifying an instrument extends to verifying an identity.

## Blocker A — Mojo children never reply ("no connection")

| # | Hypothesis | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| A1 | Socket layer broken | DISPROVEN | Send and receive both demonstrably worked cross-process. |
| A2 | fd inheritance wrong | DISPROVEN | Child had the channel at the right fd, `FILE_KIND_SOCKET`. |
| A3 | SCM_RIGHTS broken | DISPROVEN | Verified live, both directions. |
| A4 | Shared-memory aliasing (B3) was starving Mojo | DISPROVEN | B3 fixed; the stall survived completely unchanged. |
| A5 | **`sendto()` on AF_UNIX was never implemented** | **CONFIRMED** | `[chan]` args+returns showed `sendto fd=5 len=80 -> -88` (ENOTSOCK). `lx_send` handled only UDP/TCP; `recvfrom` and `sendmsg` both had AF_UNIX arms, `sendto` did not. Fixed → every -88 gone, channel round-trips (`sendto 232 -> 232` / `recvmsg -> 232`), ops **11 → 234**. |

Lesson: the framing "browser never sends **or** child never receives" was wrong
on *both* counts — the child replied every time and **the kernel refused the
call**. The recent-syscall ring logs names only and structurally could not show
a failing return; that is why this survived three slices.

## GPU process dies at ~14 s

| # | Hypothesis | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| G1 | GPU watchdog self-terminates | DISPROVEN | Source: `DeliberatelyTerminateToRecoverFromHang` → `TerminateCurrentProcessImmediately` = `_exit()`, not a signal. |
| G2 | **The browser SIGKILLs its own GPU child** | **CONFIRMED** | `[sig] sig=9 -> pid=16 FROM pid=2 'chrome'`. Chrome's own recovery path; logs WARNING and respawns. **Not a tobyOS bug.** |
| G3 | It is purely an emulation-speed timeout artifact | LARGELY DISPROVEN | Still happens under WHPX at ~4.5× TCG speed. |

Trap recorded: the harness DOES pass `--disable-gpu`; the swiftshader flags in
`[execve-argv]` belong to a **utility** child, not the browser.

## Native browser could not start (YouTube test)

| # | Hypothesis | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| N1 | My struct-layout changes broke it | DISPROVEN | Clean rebuild reproduced identically. |
| N2 | Partial-build struct mismatch | DISPROVEN | Same after `make clean`. |
| N3 | **Chrome's 262 MB payload in the initrd starved guest RAM** | **CONFIRMED** | `[pmm] managed: 34 MiB` vs 511 MiB historically; initrd was 387 MB with 413 chrome files. Parked payload → 337 MiB, `gui_browser ALIVE`. |

Result: YouTube renders its pre-hydration shell only (`Done - 15 links`), no
content grid, no video — matching the documented architectural ceiling.

## WHPX / real-hardware fidelity

| # | Hypothesis | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| W1 | CPU-model divergence under WHPX | DISPROVEN | Identical #GP with `-cpu qemu64`. |
| W2 | SMP/AP GDT or TSS bring-up | DISPROVEN | Identical with `-smp 1`. |
| W3 | **STAR[63:48] = 0x10 → SYSRET leaves SS.RPL = 0** | **CONFIRMED** | #GP error code `0x18` named GDT index 3; dumped iret frame read `cs=0x23 ss=0x18`. SYSRET forces CS.RPL but **not** SS.RPL. Base → 0x13. WHPX boots clean (0 panics); TCG unchanged; stock boot clean. **Every ring-3 return since the first syscall was riding an illegal frame.** Strong candidate for the open EliteDesk real-HW divergences. |

## The system wedge at ~14 s (current front)

| # | Hypothesis | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| D1 | Renderer spins in user code | DISPROVEN | Ring-3 profiler: only 1–4 samples per 3 s interval — barely any user time. |
| D2 | `clock_gettime` spin loop starves the renderer | DISPROVEN | Per-caller breakdown: renderer's mix is `mprotect`/`openat`/`fstat`/`rt_sigaction` — healthy init; clock calls spread across 5 tids (normal TimeTicks). **I read an aggregate before decomposing it.** |
| D3 | `clock_gettime` ignores clock_id + 1 ms granularity | REAL-BUT-NOT-THE-CAUSE | Genuine bug — all clocks returned ms-since-boot, so everything believed it was Jan 1 1970. Fixed (chrome now reports the true date). **Did not change the wedge.** |
| D4 | The renderer just needs more time | DISPROVEN | 25 min wall → **0.8 s** of guest progress. Not slow: wedged. |
| D5 | The wedge is a WHPX artifact (`MSI ... lost`) | DISPROVEN | TCG wedges identically, same signature. |
| D6 | `sched_enqueue` self-cycles the queue TAIL | REAL-BUT-NOT-THE-CAUSE | Guard was `next_ready != NULL`, but the tail has `next_ready == NULL` → re-enqueuing the tail sets `p->next_ready = p`. Genuine latent bug, fixed with an `on_rq` flag under the lock. **But children ran fine before the fix (37) and after (35): not this hang.** |
| D7 | `proc_reap` zeroes a slot some list still points at | DISPROVEN | `[reap!]` audit walked every ready queue before each `memset`: **0 hits** in a full run. |
| D8 | The parent never returns from fork | DISPROVEN | 4 forks, **4** clone-returns. First attempt showed 0 returns only because I instrumented `LX_fork` while chrome forks via `clone()` — the count mismatch caught my own instrument error. |
| D9 | Missed futex wakeup | LARGELY DISPROVEN | Address-matched `[futex]` instrument: 75 WAIT / 181 WAKE, and the waits observed around the stop **return 0** (i.e. they were woken). Note the instrument's blind spot: it logs *after* the call, so a permanently-blocked wait is invisible to it — but nothing points to one. Long 6–9 s waits are chrome's idle thread-pool workers parking on purpose. |
| D10 | Serial TX ring fills → output dropped, so the "wedge" is log loss not a hang | DISPROVEN | Added a drop counter and grew the ring 8 KiB → 256 KiB: **`logdrop=0`**, run still stops at ~13.9 s with 4 heartbeats. Not one byte was ever lost. **Also retracted the reasoning:** the "more tracing → earlier stop" trend was confounded — the early 22–24 s runs predate the `sendto` fix, when chrome stalled instead of respawning GPU processes. Different workload, not different log volume. |

| D11 | The guest HALTS rather than hangs | CONFIRMED (and it is worse than a halt) | `timeout 400` returned **rc=0**: QEMU exited on its own. A hung guest keeps QEMU alive. With `-no-reboot` a **triple fault** makes QEMU exit — which is what it is. |
| D12 | **`proc_context_switch` loads a CR3 that does not map the kernel** | **CONFIRMED — root cause of the "wedge"** | `-d int,cpu_reset` caught the chain: `v=0e e=0018 cpl=0 IP=ffffffff80151154 CR2=ffffffff80151154` (page fault where **CR2 == IP**, instruction-fetch, present-bit clear) → `v=08` (#DF) → `Triple fault`. Symbolized: `0x...151154` is the instruction **immediately after `mov %rdx,%cr3`** in `proc_context_switch`. Switching into a dead address space unmaps the kernel, so the next fetch faults and no handler can run. |

### Why every earlier reading was wrong

There was never a hang, a scheduler cycle, a futex deadlock, or log loss. The
machine **triple-faults and dies instantly**. No panic could ever print, because
the panic handler was unmapped along with the rest of the kernel. Everything
that looked like a "wedge" was simply the machine being gone.

Corollary for future work: **a silent stop with QEMU exiting rc=0 under
`-no-reboot` means a triple fault.** Reach for `-d int,cpu_reset` FIRST; it took
one run to produce the exact faulting instruction after a long detour through
scheduler, futex and serial theories.

### Open: which CR3, and why is it dead

Prime suspect is a **PML4 use-after-free**. `proc_reap` calls
`vmm_destroy_user_pml4(p->cr3)` when `owns_pml4 && !is_thread`. If any THREAD of
that group is still alive (threads share the leader's `cr3` and have
`owns_pml4 == false`), destroying the leader's tables leaves those threads
pointing at freed page tables — and the first switch into one triple-faults.
Chrome's GPU respawn loop (SIGKILL the process, reap it, immediately fork a
replacement into the same slot) is exactly the churn that would expose it.

Next step: assert in `proc_context_switch`'s caller that the target `cr3` is
live, and in `proc_reap` that no other proc shares the `cr3` about to be
destroyed.

### What is established about the wedge

Not fork. The parent forks the replacement GPU process, returns, creates its
shared memory, and sends the 184-byte Mojo invitation — *then* everything stops:

```
[14440] fork returns 17
[14441] shm region created
[14442] scm sendmsg passing 1 fd
[14442] sendmsg fd=64 -> 184      <- silence, heartbeat dead
```

Silent: no crash, no panic, no exception. Reproducible on **both** TCG and WHPX.

## Standing lessons

- **Decompose before concluding.** D2 and D8 both came from reading a total
  instead of a per-caller/per-path breakdown. Both were one command from truth.
- **Put counters on instruments.** The 4-vs-0 fork mismatch exposed a bad
  instrument rather than producing a false finding.
- **Check the run actually got there.** Counts for anything deadline-driven
  (`with no connection` fires at 15 s) are meaningless without the last
  `[N ms]`. Chrome now runs at ~4 % real-time under TCG.
- **A "verified working" claim is only verified for the path that exercised it.**
